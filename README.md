### The Approach
The approach used in completing this project follows the outlines for the project.  In brief, these steps included:
1. Downloading data and saving it to disk locally.
2. Loading the data into R
3. Merging several datasets
4. Selecting the relevant columns
5. Renaming columns for clarity and organizing ("tidying") the data appropriately.
6. Summarizing and calculating the values required for output.
7. Saving the final results file locally.

These steps are documented in the run_analysis.R script in this repository.
