# Codebook
This Codebook explains the various variables and data used in the run_analysis.R script.  In the final_df.csv file, the data has the following names and descriptions:

| Variable name	  | Description |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| subjectid  | The ID number associated with the subject who performed the activity for each observation. Its range is from 1 to 30. |
| activity	 | The name of the activity.  There are six:  WALKING, LAYING, SITTING, STANDING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS and WALKING_UPSTAIRS. |
| instrument | The name of the instrument that collected the information ("Acc" - acceleromter OR "Gyro" - gyroscope) |
| signal     | The name of the measurement being taken.  There are three possible values:  "Body", "Gravity" OR "BodyBody". "Body" and "Gravity" are components of the sensor acceleration signal.  "BodyBody" is not explained in the original data.   |
| jerk | Indicates whether or not the data was from a Jerk signal. |
| magnitude |  The magnitude of the three-dimensional signals, calculated using the Euclidean norm. |
| domain     | The domain from which the data originated ("time" - a time series OR "frequency" - frequencies) |
| measure    | Identifies what is being measured: the "mean" (the arithmetic average) or the "std" (i.e., standard deviation) |
| axis       | Identifies which of three axes are being measured: X, Y or Z.  Some measures do not have an axis. |
| value      | The observed value for the particular subject, activity, instrument, feature, domain, measure and axis. |
| count      | The number of observations for that value. Used in the computation of the average.| 
| average    | The calculated average of all of the data points having the same set of values in the leftmost columns. |
